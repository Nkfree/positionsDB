# positionsDB
It's an addon for Tes3MP that saves position and rotation of player into LUA MODULE file that can be then directly used by other scripts.

## Installation
1. Download the ```main.lua``` and put it in */server/scripts/custom/positionsDB*
2. Open ```customScripts.lua``` and add this code on separate line: ```positionsDB = require "custom/positionsDB/main"```

The file gets automatically sorted (if you use ***alphanumerical chars***) so the entries don't get messy.
